Step 1: Requirements
--------------------

- The latest version of eZ Publish.
- An existing eZ Publish installation (Plain, Website Interface, etc.)
  Withtin the installation there should exist the following classes
  (class identifiers):
  - folder (can be choosen during installation)
  - image (will be created newly or perhaps be modified if it exists)
  - quicktime (will be created newly or perhaps be modified if it exists)
  - real_video (will be created newly or perhaps be modified if it exists)
  - window_media (will be created newly or perhaps be modified if it exists)
  - user (will be created newly or perhaps be modified if it exists)
- Furthermore the following extensions are required:
  eZ Lightbox, eZ Event, eZ JS Core, eZ XML Installer and eZ Event.
- Optionally the eZ Multiupload extension can be used to allow
  the upload of multiple files at the same time.

Step 2: Download
-----------------

If you didn't get any packages get the latest versions from
the following subversion repositories:

- eZ Publish 4.x / PHP5
  http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezteamroom/trunk
  http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezlightbox/releases/0.7.4/
Â  http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezxmlinstaller/trunk
  http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezevent/trunk
  http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezjscore/trunk
  http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezmultiupload/release/1.0.0/ (eZ 4.1.x)
- After unpacking the extensions and making them available in the
  extension directory, make sure the ownership of the files is
  correct

Step 3: Before installing eZ Teamroom
-------------------------------------

Before starting to install eZ Teamroom you should be aware of the fact
that eZ Teamroom will (perhaps) modify some content classes in the existing
eZ Publish installation. By default these are the following classes:

- image
- quicktime
- real_video
- window_media
- user

If these classes not already exist, they will be created automatically.

If you want to install eZ Teamroom there must already be an existing
eZ Publish installation. Depending on the kind of the existing installation
there are some things you should pay attention for, especially because
eZ Teamroom will install new and/or modify existing classes.

The teamroom installer will modify the user class and add attributes to
it. If you do not want this to happen you will have to modify the template

extension/ezteamroom/design/standard/templates/teamroom/installezteamroom.tpl

in the same way as described below. Besides modifying this template directly
you can also create a replacement template.

ATTENTION: Whenever you change something in the mentioned template, it could
happen that eZ Teamroom will not work as expected anymore and/or that the content
is not displayed in the correct way, within the teamrooms.
If the changes will affect content classes that already exist in your
installation, it could happen that the existing installation will not work as
expected anymore and/or that  the content is not displayed in the correct way
anymore.

- Using an installation based on the "Plain" package

  There are no doubts when installing eZ Teamroom.

- Using an installation based on the "Website Interface" package

  It is possible to install eZ Teamroom as an addition to the Website
  Interface package of for eZ Publish. Depending on your intention you
  have to decide if you want to make use of the existing classes that
  are shipped together with the Website Interface or if you want to
  have a separate set of classes for eZ Teamroom (this is the default).
  If you intend to make use of the existing Website Interface classes
  you will have to modify the template

  extension/ezteamroom/design/standard/templates/teamroom/installezteamroom.tpl

  In this template you will find the definition of the content classes
  that are going to be created / modified by the eZ Teamroom installer
  for example

  <ContentClass isContainer="false" identifier="teamroom_image" ...

  To be able to use the Website Interface classes just exchange the
  identifiers of the classes by removing the "teamroom_" prefix:

  <ContentClass isContainer="false" identifier="image" ...

  Furthermore you will have to modify the ClassIdentifiersMap[] setting
  in extension/ezteamroom/settings/teamroom.ini.append.php from for example

  ClassIdentifiersMap[image]=teamroom_image

  has to be changed to

  ClassIdentifiersMap[image]=image

- Using an existing custom installation

  If you want to install eZ Teamroom on an existing eZ Publish installation
  this is possible because eZ Teamroom will by default create its own set
  of content classes. However, if you would like eZ Teamroom to make use of
  existing content classes available in your installation this is possible.
  To do so just modify the template

  extension/ezteamroom/design/standard/templates/teamroom/installezteamroom.tpl

  as described above and use the class identifiers of the existing classes.
  Furthermore you will have to modify the ClassIdentifiersMap[] setting
  in extension/ezteamroom/settings/teamroom.ini.append.php in the same way
  as described above.

Step 4: Prepare eZ Publish
--------------------------

- ezteamroom, ezlightbox, ezxmlinstaller, ezjscore, ezevent and optionally
  ezmultiupload need to be put into the extension directory and activated
  globally by adding the extensions to settings/override/site.ini as
  follows:

  [ExtensionSettings]
  ...
  ActiveExtensions[]=ezevent
  ActiveExtensions[]=ezteamroom
  ActiveExtensions[]=ezlightbox
  ActiveExtensions[]=ezxmlinstaller
  ActiveExtensions[]=ezmultiupload
  ActiveExtensions[]=ezjscore
  ...

  When using the website interface you should make sure the that ezwebin
  extension is enabled after the ezteamroom extensions. Furthermore you
  will have to merged the "TopIdentifierList" settings in

  extension/ezteamroom/settings/siteaccess/ezteamroom/menu.ini.append.php

  with the ones in

  extension/ezwebin/settings/menu.ini.append.php

  Otherwise the top menu of the eZ Teamroom extension will not be
  displayed.

- Run bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -e

- Please make sure that you do not already have a siteaccess that
  is named 'ezteamroom'

- Don't forget to import ezlightbox databases tables
  (you will find them in extension/ezlightbox/sql/<DATABASE_HANDLER>/
   where the placeholder <DATABASE_HANDLER> has to be replaced with the name
   of the database interface you are currently using)

- Don't forget to import ezevent databases tables
  (you will find them in extension/ezevent/sql/<DATABASE_HANDLER>/ezevent.sql
   where the placeholder <DATABASE_HANDLER> has to be replaced with the name
   of the database interface you are currently using)

- Clear the cache

Step 5: Install eZ Teamroom
---------------------------
Simply run this command in your eZ publish root directory:

 "php extension/ezxmlinstaller/bin/php/xmlinstaller.php --template=teamroom/installezteamroom --siteaccess=<SITEACCESS_NAME>"

Replace the placeholder <SITEACCESS_NAME> with the name of an existing siteaccess
(not ezteamroom!) that should be used for the installation of eZ Teamroom. Make
sure that the site.ini, that is active for the choosen siteaccess, has the
[DatabaseSettings] setup correctly.
IMPORTANT: Some translations (for example the name of eZ Publish roles) depend on
the language and locale settings that are configured in the choosen siteaccess. This
means if the siteaccess that has been choosen for the installation of eZ Teamroom
has English as the primary language configured those parts of eZ Teamroom will also
be created in that language.

The script will ask for some settings. Just press enter to use the default
values. Please do not wonder about "Object exists" messages as they appear by default.

The script will do the following things:
 - Install teamroom classes
 - Setup roles and policies
 - Create eZ Teamroom content
 - Create eZ Teamroom siteaccess ("ezteamroom")
 - Setup workflows and triggers

If you want to know in detail what will be done, check and "read" this file:

extension/ezteamroom/design/standard/templates/teamroom/installezteamroom.tpl

Here is the XML definition what will happen.

Step 6: Postconfiguration
-------------------------
The following things should be done after the installation has finished:
- Configure the SiteaccessSettings in override/site.ini to your needs
  (Host-Match or URI Match things)
- Configure the database settings in the ezteamroom siteaccess (if it is not
  set globally)
- Remove the PathPrefix setting from settings/siteaccess/ezteamroom/site.ini.append.php
  and extension/ezteamroom/settings/siteaccess/ezteamroom/site.ini.append.php if you use
  host based access method
  IMPORTANT: If you want to rename the 'Teamrooms' node, you also need to ensure that
  the PathPrefix settings is changed in settings/siteaccess/ezteamroom/site.ini.append.php
  and in extension/ezteamroom/settings/siteaccess/ezteamroom/site.ini.append.php
- IMPORTANT:
  If there is a SiteURL setting in settings/override/site.ini.append.php you should move it
  to the siteaccess settings for all siteaccesses. This setting will be used in emails that
  are sent out by the teamroom extension.
- Optional:
  If you would like anonymous users to access the teamrooms, just set RequireUserLogin=false
  in settings/siteaccess/ezteamroom/site.ini.append.php and add a policy to the anonymous user
  role that grants access to user/login for the ezteamroom siteaccess.
- Optional:
  Assign the role "Anonymous" (or perhaps also other existing roles) to the group used
  by the teamroom (e.g. Members) and add [UserSettings] DefaultUserPlacement=<NODEID> to the
  site.ini if you want newly registered users to be placed in this group by default
- Setup a system cronjob that executes the "frequent" cronjob part of eZ Publish using the
  ezteamroom siteaccess:

  php runcronjobs.php -s ezteamroom frequent

  If you are not able to use the ezteamroom siteaccesss for some reason, you should adjust the
  email templates in extension/ezteamroom/design/standard/templates/teamroom/mail/ and change
  the path to the teamrooms.
- Clear the cache

Step 7: Create a first teamroom
-------------------------------
- Access the teamroom frontpage using http://<YOUR_HOST>/ezteamroom (or http://<YOUR_HOST>/
  if you choosed the host based access method)
- Register a new user or login as an existing user
- Access the frontpage and click on "Create Teamroom" within the appropriate box
- Enter all required information in the upcoming form and click on the "Create" button
- Wait until the "frequent" cronjob has been run (unfinished teamroom are marked with a "*")
- Enter Teamroom and enjoy

HowTo customize the teamroom?
-----------------------------

In the same way as it is possible to adjust the installation of eZ Teamroom,
it is possible to modify the installation of new teamrooms within eZ Teamroom.

To do so one has to modify the template

ezteamroom/design/standard/templates/teamroom/createteamroom.tpl

However, modifying this template should only be done by experienced people
who know about eZ Teamroom and eZ XML Installer. Besides modifying this template
directly you can also create a replacement template.

Some further documentation can be found in the ezxmlinstaller extension.
